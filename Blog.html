        <p>“Take your mind off your pain” is a common phrase you will hear from compassionate family members, disparaging strangers and even from the doctor within the clinic. You'll see this approach in action when you aggressively hum the theme to Eastenders after stubbing your toe, or when you distract yourself from your back pain by getting absorbed into the guitar solo of your favourite song (Slash- Anastasia, for those wondering).

    <br>However, here are two different ways of thinking about what happens when you alleviate your pain in these ways: If you view pain in a 'mind-centric' way, you are genuinely reducing or eliminating your pain when you distract yourself from it. But a 'body-centric' view, where pain is identified based on some type of tissue damage, you aren't actually reducing or eliminating your pain when you're distracted from it. Your attention is just directed somewhere else. Does one or the other of these conceptions better capture the way that we ordinarily think about pain?<br>

    <br>As I think I've mentioned before, the definition of pain given by the International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP) does not come down decisively in favour of a mind-centric or body-centric view of pain. The IASP definition involves both tissue damage (actual or potential) and a mental, affective component: Pain is “An unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with, or resembling that associated with, actual or potential tissue damage, or described in terms of such damage”. Among pain researchers and pain practitioners this is a widely accepted definition, so we were surprised when we came across some experimental work by Justin Sytsma (2010) and Kevin Reuter and colleagues (2014) that argued that the way people think about pain is body-centric, in contrast with the received professional view that pain is a hybrid of bodily and mental factors.<br>

    <br>These experimental results, suggesting that people have an exclusively body-centric view of pain, are highly surprising and contradict some of the most fundamental premises of the clinical scientific study of pain. If these experimental findings stand up to scrutiny, they should have far-reaching consequences for how practitioners should understand patients' pain reports. Common complaints from pain patients are that they feel unheard, or that they clinicians do not understand the real problems underlying their conditions. The body-centric experimental results suggest a potential cause of this disconnect: Maybe the general public view pain as body-centric, whereas experts view it as mind-centric? The group talking about oranges aren't being heard by the group listening out for apples.<br>

    <br>Consider a vignette that Sytsma (2010) gave to participants to evaluate how they thought about pain: Bobby and Robby are conjoined twins who share a leg. While running through a park, they hit their shared leg on a large rock and both grimace and say “ouch!”. In this situation, did Bobby and Robby feel one and the same pain? Or did they feel two different pains? People tended to respond that Bobby and Robby feel one and the same pain. Sytsma argues that it “is the number of afflicted appendages, not the number of perceiving brains, that best corresponds with the number of pains reported”.<br>

    <br>Our group of psychologists, neuroscientists, and philosophers set out to investigate these surprising findings. Our hypothesis was that, consistent with the received wisdom built into the IASP definition according to which pain has both mental and bodily aspects, the public can view their pain as being body-centric or mind-centric, depending on how questions about pain are framed. We completed a three-stage study that we think indicates that people think of pain as a hybrid of mental and bodily aspects, rather than as purely body-centric (or mind-centric).<br>

    <br>First, we replicated Sytsma's (2010) results using his experimental materials. This is crucial, because we need to make sure that our online data collection strategy was reliable and provided the same results. Happily, it did!<br>

    <br>Second, we looked at whether a different set of vignettes than those used by Sytsma would elicit a different, more mind-centric response from our participants. We developed eight new vignettes that were designed to pull apart the experience of the subjects in the vignettes from their injuries. If you'd like to read the full set of vignettes, you can find them in this paper<a href="(https://tinyurl.com/z6a6er4r)">(https://tinyurl.com/z6a6er4r)</a>. For now, compare one of Sytsma's original vignettes that produces what he interprets as a body-centric response, with one of our vignettes that elicits a more mind-centric response:<br>

    <br>Sytsma's body-centric vignette: Bobby and Robby are conjoined twins who share a leg. While running through a park, their shared leg accidentally kicks a large rock and both grimace and say “ouch!”. In this situation, did Bobby and Robby feel one and the same pain? Or did they feel two different pains? People tended to respond that Bobby and Robby feel one and the same pain. Sytsma argues that it “is the number of afflicted appendages, not the number of perceiving brains, that best corresponds with the number of pains reported”.<br>

    <br>Our mind-centric version: Adam and Zed are conjoined twins who share a leg. While running through a park, their shared leg accidentally kicks a large rock. Adam, but not Zed, grimaces and says “ouch!”. They examine their shared leg and agree that there is tissue damage (it is scraped where it hit the rock), but only Adam says that it hurts; Zed insists that it doesn't. When we asked participants to indicate whether in this vignette Adam has pain, or Zed has pain (or both), participants tended to respond that only Adam has pain. That response is inconsistent with a purely body-centric view of pain.<br>

    <br>So, together, we firstly replicated Sytsma's findings of a body-centric view of pain using his vignettes. Secondly, our vignettes that painted a more plausible mind-centric viewpoint provided data that were inconsistent with a purely body-centric view of pain. This supports our hypothesis that, “while the general public can view pain as being body-centric, they don't have an exclusively body-centric view of pain”. Given the right framing, they can also conceptualise pain as a mind-centric phenomenon.<br>

    <br>The results from our first two studies prompted a follow-up question. We know what happens when we deliver independent sets of vignettes which encourage body- or mind-centric responses, but what happens what they are delivered together? Do responses remain stable or does the combination of vignettes that encourage body-centric and mind-centric responses alongside one another moderate participants' responses in any way? We designed a study to evaluate this question, and we found that participants still had mind-centric responses to vignettes designed to encourage a mind-centric response, though the responses were less mind-centric than when the vignettes appeared by themselves. One potential explanation of this result is that the presence of the vignettes that encourage body-centric responses are moderating participants' responses to the vignettes designed to encourage mind-centric responses. Additionally, it may be that in the body-centric vignettes, there is a very clear path between injury and pain, and this is highly intuitive. The mind-centric vignettes sometimes have more obscurity than this, and so when presented together, the participant's conviction on their ratings on these was challenged and they were more uncertain.<br>

    <br>Altogether, our results challenge the surprising claim that the general public endorse a purely body-centric perspective. The bodily aspect of pain can be made salient in the right kind of context, but our results support the received wisdom among pain theorists and practitioners that people's view of pain is a hybrid combining both mental and bodily aspects.<br>

    <br>Unlike my other blog pieces, this blog was supported and written by the entire research team. As I'm mentioned in my more casual pieces before, interdisciplinary research is a core pillar of my work, and personally, one the favourite parts of my jobs. This project would not have been possible without the skill and specialism of every member of the team, from philosophers, to psychologists, to clinicians. This project is currently in the clinical stage, and we are collecting data from chronic pain patients, to understand if this spectrum relates to how people view their treatment options and respond to them. Undoutedly, I'll be updating you all about this in due course, but for now, thank you for reading and continue to stay safe!<br>

    <article id="a2"><p>This will be a much shorter post than normal, mainly as the topic is directed to my attendance at the annual meeting of RCOG, to present my hysteroscopy manuscript. The other reason is that, outside of inane and specific challenges I'm facing with analysis, continued lockdown has really put a cramp on our research (there's not much to report!). I'm hoping this is soon to be a concern of the past, although I'm also wary of the power of a jinx, so less said the better.<br>

        <br>I won't go into detail about the paper underlying the presentation itself. If you missed my last entry, I hope this will give you an easily digestible synopsis (<a href="http://richaharrison.com/pain-free-hysteroscopy/">"http://richaharrison.com/pain-free-hysteroscopy/"</a>). The only thing I wanted to discuss today was the reception of the work itself.<br>

        <br>I won't lie that I was experiencing trepidation in the lead up to the presentation, as many clinical friends had suggested that I may be in for a baptism of fire. Generally, human beings do not like being told what they are doing is wrong, or that there is fallibility in the way they do things. With the power of an in-group, I can see how presenting a critical message of hysteroscopy to the membership body that binds gynaecologists together could elicit furore. However, this is not something I experienced at all, and I consider this a very promising and reassuring finding indeed.<br>

        <br>For those who wish to see the presentation, you can find it here (<a href="http://richaharrison.com/media/">http://richaharrison.com/media/</a>). If you have watched it, you'll likely notice the findings are quite compelling, and the data indicates a near-normal distribution in pain ratings, in opposition of the described low-to-no pain. That is the primary discursive point of the paper in my view, and is one that seemed to be very well received at RCOG. The dialogue I was able to open is a real success of the meeting, and is something that is sorely required.<br>

        <br>The main reason underlying me building a website in the first place, is that the largest challenge in research is dissemination. Getting your findings and stories out into the real world. While RCOG still represents a specific subset of research-minded, driven, passionate and forward thinking clinicians, it is important that the data permeates the clinical world as much as possible. I find it very pleasing that the main piece of feedback I received at the conference, from multiple mouths, was “This is remarkable, it seems impossible that the procedure can be described like that, when the data shows the opposite”. I couldn't have written a better piece of feedback myself.<br>

        <br>Lastly, I'm not sure if those who sent the messages will necessarily read this, but one more unexpected benefit arose from my attendance of RCOG. I have received 8 or 9 genuinely thoughtful messages of thanks, which have buoyed me. There are many downsides to lockdown, including the forced isolation via working from home. To receive positive feedback regarding our work, and to hear that our research is being appreciated, has been a real antidote to this psychological challenge. I can't speak from my co-authors (although I expect they'd agree with me), but the only thing that really matters is that our research makes a difference somewhere down the line. So, thank you for your thank yous, the words carry great weight and appreciation. Keep staying safe, keep staying healthy and keep wearing a mask.</p></article>

        <article id="a3"><p>It is unlikely to be controversial for me to suggest that pain is not merely a product of sensory stimulation (please excuse that rather clunky double-negative). I have previously mentioned the annals of Henry Beecher, wherein soldiers during World War II were observed to decline analgesia despite serious battle wounds or pending medical interventions1. More colloquially, I have vivid memories of my younger self coming off the football pitch at half-time and only then noticing a deep cut to the shin or blood pouring from the knee. The Cartesian premise of the brain simply representing a “bell on the end of the rope”, which rings when the rope is tugged via a hammer-blow to the hand, struggles to mould around these examples2. However, these examples could be said to just reflect an attentional or motivational conflict. The soldiers had more pressing or life-threatening issues on their mind, and I was absorbed by the competition of sport to notice.<br>

            <br> We also know that the influence on pain processing can precede the injury as well. Placebo-focused pain research has shown us that an inert analgesia can reduce the experience of the painful stimulation that follows3. What's more, the manipulation of expectation doesn't even need to be physical via the application of a cream or IV. Just by telling people that the stimulation is likely to be more (or less) painful you can alter their very experience to a stable noxious (read: potentially harmful) stimulus4. This has been observed in self-reported pain ratings, as well as underlying neural activation in the brain5. Tellingly, a large focus of this research has focused on the potency of prediction errors. A recent paper published out of the University of Manchester encapsulated prediction errors with great articulation (in my opinion)6. The researchers wrote:<br>

            <br>“Imagine having a calm picnic in the garden, when you are suddenly stung by a wasp. Although you had no reason to expect any pain before being stung, you immediately feel searing pain. The discrepancy between prior pain expectations, which in this example were null, and the sensory evidence, here the bodily response to the venom in the sting, is termed pain prediction error (PE)”– Hird et al., page 2, 2019.<br>

            <br>The paper provides critical nuance for those who are interested in prediction errors, and I recommend reading it in full if you wish to learn more of this phenomenon. But, for the purpose of this blog, I'd like to keep that quote in mind while I talk about my own publication, examining the gynaecological procedure of hysteroscopy7.<br>

            <br>The British Journal of Anaesthesia recently published our paper representing work over several years between the Royal Berkshire Hospital and University of Reading, empirically investigating reports of intense pain being experienced during hysteroscopy. Importantly, at the onset, this procedure was advertised as being pain-free or associated with minimal pain, which can be sufficiently managed via over-the-counter analgesics. The movement away from sedation was advocated via technological improvements to surgical equipment, and supported by findings of substantial reductions in financial cost and healthcare provider resources8. I feel it is pertinent to mention the instigation for this work was led via gynaecologists in the hospital itself, who were personally concerned by experiences with some of their patients, and insisted upon the collection of data to quantify the extent of this problem. At this point, I was entirely naive towards hysteroscopy. I found the results truly alarming, and since then, have learned a lot about the plight of patients nationwide who have suffered from this procedure. I wish to share our results for them, as well as all women who will one day undergo hysteroscopy. Please read the paper for a full recount, as I am not describing the full study here, but I want to share two interesting findings in particular.<br>

            <br>For this paper, we analysed the data of 804 hysteroscopy patients who underwent hysteroscopy, focusing on their pain ratings and the quantity of local anaesthetic administered. Our research questions focused on whether patients reported pain from their procedure and whether local anaesthetic was used appropriately to manage pain. As mentioned, our analysis yielded surprising results. Firstly, and unequivocally, the evidence suggested that hysteroscopy is not pain-free. In fact, it is often associated with pain, with a substantial subset of patients rating severe pain. Specifically, 7.8% reported no pain, with 17.6% reporting pain between 7-10 (on a 0-10 scale). Pharmacological pain management within this protocol is limited to the application of 0-3 units of local anaesthetic. We identified that very few patients received the maximal dose of anaesthetic (1.9%) and many patients received none at all (37.7%). Within those who received a non-maximal dose, a large proportion reported severe pain, between 7-10. Two clear conclusions from this data are that hysteroscopy is rarely pain-free, and that pain management represents a clear practical target for improving the outcomes of hysteroscopy.<br>
                        <br>Personally, I have noted how surprised, absorbed and passionate I have become during my time involved in this project. I have been blown away with the passion and drive of campaigns and charities trying to raise public awareness of this clinical issue. I have been emotionally impacted by the personal reports of women who have been mistreated or traumatised during poor hysteroscopies. But I have also been caught off guard with how little empirical investigation has been conducted alongside this. To my knowledge, our work represents the first published empirical project providing support for the presence of pain in hysteroscopy. Something which has been greatly missing to further the arguments for reviewing the protocols underlying the procedure. One thing I feel I can say, with empirical backing, is that hysteroscopy should be advertised alongside warnings for the potential for pain and all women should be given honest and accurate information, to enable them to make fully informed choices. This is not just pertinent for morality, ethics and medical professionalism. It also relates to the wasp at the picnic…<br>

            <br>Scientifically, we know that pain is malleable and personal. Expectations are not just a pre-clinical consideration. Expectations have bearing on the experience of pain in the future. The dangers of advertising hysteroscopy as a mildly painful procedure are many. Firstly, this stands to put women off engaging with a very useful diagnostic test for the identification of serious medical conditions, such as ovarian cancer or endometriosis. But secondly, it is highly plausible that the resulting prediction error stands to make the experience even more painful than if patients were appropriately warned. If hysteroscopy is marketed to be a tranquil picnic, it is crucial that the risk of wasp sting is non-existent (or at least rare). Our findings suggest the picnic is only tranquil 7% of the time. This, at the very least, must be changed.<br>

            <br>It is always important to try and find the positive story, even within stories that are predominantly negative, such as this. My viewpoint is that our project represents the full power of collaborations across disciplines and perspectives. When clinicians, patients, scientists and government work together, we can achieve great things. This project would not have been possible without empathic and concerned clinicians wishing to understand why so many patients in their care were suffering. My research team were able to appropriately analyse the results to unearth a cohesive and congruent narrative, founded in empirical data. The insight and advice from the Campaign Against Painful Hysteroscopy brought me up to speed with the scope of the problem. And the patients who have suffered from this procedure ensured I appropriately understood the humanity and reality of the issue.<br>

            <br>I have tried (and likely failed) to keep this brief and concise, as I know that life can be a busy place. I have also tried to avoid jargon and scientific wish-wash along the way. I am aware that my article will not be available to all, and want to ensure that the message reaches those who need to read it. As with all my research, please feel free to contact me if you wish to ask me any questions or clarifications. My blog gives me an opportunity to provide some of my opinions alongside the empirical evidence that we report. I know that this is an incredibly delicate subject for some, and many have been adversely impacted by hysteroscopy. If I have offended anyone with my description of the problem or my findings, accept my apologies. I wish the campaigners the best of luck with their pursuit of change, and hope that our science provides some weaponry with which to arm your fight.<br>

            <article id="a4"><p>To start off, for any fellow nerds that may read this. I'm sorry to disappoint, this is not a comprehensive review article on the psychological concept of intolerance of uncertainty (let's get the acronym out of the way, IoU). However, happily, it is definitely related. From what I understand, IoU represents a tendency to react negatively to events that are unpredictable or uncertain. If anyone remembers the game Crocodile Dentist (by far my favourite reptilian-based dental boardgame), you may be able to conjure the mental representation of IoU to the forefront of your mind. Some of us may just dive in, where others may sit and agonise.<br>

                <br>The brain is my favourite organ (for those that need to know- 2: Liver, 3: Pancreas, 4: Heart, 5: [CENSORED FOR REASONS OF CAREER PROGRESSION]). It is the ultimate Holmesian entity. From the day you are born, it is absorbing every last essence of data to make predictions about how to engage with life. Life is incredibly uncertain. On a minute-by-minute basis, your brain will be making erroneous decisions and having to correct itself for next time. For example, I just reached for the word erroneous and found the word erogenous (likely in part due to my 5th favourite organ). When dealing with real-life, you are dealing with a far more complex environment. I feel qualified as a psychologist to say that human-beings represent the apex of this complexity. We are hard to read, but we are also hard to interact with sometimes. If you analyse it, any of your standard weeks will be a long chain of uncertainty, being tackled by your best predictions, and often being rebuffed or incorrect. It is easy to see why being vulnerable to handling uncertainty would be disadvantageous. In fact, intolerance to uncertainty has been linked to generalised anxiety disorder, panic, OCD and social anxiety. All in all, it's not tremendously surprising really.<br>

                <br>However, feeding into the theme of uncertainty. Why am I mentioning any of this? Because, for me, a career in research and academia at present needs to be understood as an enormous challenge in tolerating uncertainty. I'm getting more and more requests to speak to young potential scientists about a career in research, and despite my 'cup-half-full' mentality, it feels unreasonable to hide this fact from them. A few of them, I'm told, are even reading this. Over the past 6 months, I've been contemplating whether to stay in research at all. This is despite it being, to-date, the best and most enjoyable job I have ever had. It doesn't even take much truth be told. Manuscripts perennially in need of improvement before submission, grants being pulled (sometimes a day before the interview), unreasonable reviewers, but ultimately, two core concepts. Uncertainty as to whether I am actually going to have a job in 6 months and uncertainty as to whether I am good enough. Importantly, these are characteristics shared at some point by every single scientist I know (except the narcissists, but let's leave them to one side for now).<br>

                <br>BUT, I have a belief that morose and pitiful narratives are overplayed these days. I wouldn't like to put my name to something needlessly defeatist. The key concept within IoU for me is tolerance. It's something that can make you more resilient than you'd ever think possible. Sometimes you'll be ahead, sometimes you'll be behind. Some results are going to be worst than you expected, but sometimes you'll get it spot on. It's a little like the weather, sometimes your BBQ will be a washout and you can't help it, but sometimes, you'll get that perfect day. This week, alongside a co-investigator, I was awarded my first ever grant to continue my studies into presurgical assessments for those undergoing knee surgery across the next 3 years. The aim being to identify those who are most vulnerable, raise a red flag, and give them the support they need before undergoing unnecessary surgery that will only make things worse. Two days after this grant, a long agonised but important paper on pain during hysteroscopy (watch this space for a synopsis post) was accepted at the British Journal of Anaesthesia. All of a sudden, the washout BBQ is actually becoming brighter!<br>

                <br>I never really know what these blog posts are, or who they are useful for. Once lockdown has lifted, I hope to start infusing more science and dissemination into the themes. But during these rather odd times, I'm noticing the mental health and morale of my colleagues and friends dipping with every passing month (while making it clear that I am no different to them in this regard!). The core messages are: for those in research and academia, know that you will be forced to tolerate a great deal of uncertainty throughout your career, and you are not failing when it becomes intolerable. Just like the weather, the grey, wet and dull days cannot by definition last forever. Keep attentive to your own mental health, and do not be afraid to ask for help or to take a break. If you are in your early career, reach out to mentors and fellow ECRs. We're all feeling like imposters, and we all note that literally everyone appears to be more intelligent than we are. When you've had enough, reached your limit, and find it's no longer giving you any enjoyment, don't be afraid to move on and try something else. You're not a failure, you've just made a very difficult decision for the benefit of your own future. That seems like a success to me!<br>

                <br>“In the face of uncertainty, there is nothing wrong with hope”. Dunno who said it, but I like it! Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to go celebrate a good week with a rousing game of Crocodile Dentist.<br></p></article>

                <article id="a5"><p>It seems for better or worse, out of wisdom or foolishness, based on scientific evidence or financial desperation- lockdown is coming to an end. The spectre of a “second wave” was initially something to avoid at all costs, but is now seen as an inevitability. My personal view (and it's my blog, so why the dickens not?) is that the 'novelty' of the pandemic for many has worn off, and the sheer inconvenience of lockdown has becoming more boring than exciting. Across from my house, the basketball court has been hosting full-contact matches between 10-15 people for the past 2 weeks and during a recent masked-up trip to the shops, groups of friends were taking up aisles to chat (but don't worry, the pubs are opening up in 5 days…).<br>

                    <br>Although more anecdotal than empirical (more blag, than blog?), I can't be the only one who realises when we make these decisions, we are saying that returning to normal quickly justifies the extra few thousands of vulnerable people who will lose their lives. The pursuit of haircuts or Primark bargains outweighed the boring chore of social distancing and protection. This may very well be an inevitable sacrifice, we can't stay lockdowned forever after all, the UK would go bust before too long. However, it does strike me as odd that no-one comes out and just says it. But then again, perhaps that would be a bad quote for a re-election campaign? Better to “stay alert” and “follow scientific guidance” (although let's put a pin in this one if the advice happens to sounds a trifle too cautious or expensive).<br>

                    <br>For junior researchers, like myself, perhaps I'm clinging tightly onto lockdown because of the starkness of my immediate future. The majority of British Universities have been working on shoestring budgets for as long as I've been associated with them. During my six years in research, I have worked voluntarily for one year, and earned £13k p/a for four. My funding has expired three times, I have taken out one bank loan, and funded two international conference travel costs myself. I want to INSIST that this is not me playing the world's smallest violin or making myself out as a martyr. All my fellow early career researchers have been forced to make similar sacrifices to pursue a cause they feel passionate about. But let me point out, this was BEFORE Covid. I've heard estimates of a £100m shortfall having to now be patched, with Brexit removing a large source of our income. Our future is bleak. Many will lose their jobs. These funding gaps will not be filled for all. Bank loans will become compulsory for some. We will lose a lot of individuals who could have stood to make a real difference.<br>

                    <br>For my part in this, I will say, my department, mentors and clinical colleagues in NHS have been more supportive than I could have imagined. They have been amazing. So, in the meantime, we will continue to knock on every door to try to continue our work in pain research and trying to improve the lives of chronic pain sufferers. We will pester and irritate the every-longing bejeesus out of the budget setters and powers that be to not let it collapse, and aim for a life after lockdown with some real positives. I'm aware in my line of work, my fingers live permanently in a crossed position, but I may staple them just to be on the safe side.<br>

                    <br>But for now, to anyone that reads, please say safe, please wear a mask, please think of the workers in the NHS cleaning up our lapses in judgement and please continue to be kind to each other. After all, that last one could stand to be one real benefit from this whole Covid mess.<br></p></article>
