<article class="videoRight"><p>I was invited by BBC Berkshire to provide some insight into the Nobel Prize award for Dr David Julius and Dr Ardem Patapoutian, as well as our pain research in Berkshire.

<p>I was recently invited to present my work on pain during hysteroscopy at the Royal College of Obstetrics &amp; Gynaecology. Although I was pre-emptively worried about a defensive reaction from the clinical community, the poster was very well received and I received a lot of positive feedback on the importance of our work.

<p>This was recorded while introducing BBC Berkshire and its listeners to the CINN Pain lab and the type of research we undertake at Reading. I am joined by Dr Wiebke Gandhi from my lab to give Phil Kennedy and Jo Beck a demonstration of our work and an overview of why we do exactly what we do.</p>
