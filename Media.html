<h2>BBC Berkshire - Nobel Prize Interview</h2>
<article class="videoRight"><p>I was invited by BBC Berkshire to provide some insight into the Nobel Prize award for Dr David Julius and Dr Ardem Patapoutian, as well as our pain research in Berkshire. Dr Julius & Patapoutian won their Nobel prize due to their groundbreaking work on neural pathology, and their joint discoveries of sensory nerves that respond selectively to heat, pressure and cold.  </p>

<h2>The Royal College of Obstetricians & Gynaecologists</h2>
   
<p>I was recently invited to present my work on pain during hysteroscopy at the Royal College of Obstetrics & Gynaecology. Although I was pre-emptively worried about a defensive reaction from the clinical community, the poster was very well received and I received a lot of positive feedback on the importance of our work. Click to the right to have a look at my presentation, I’d recommend full-screen if you’d like to read some of the more specific points.    </p>
