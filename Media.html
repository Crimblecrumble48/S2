<h2 class="h2Right">BBC Berkshire - Nobel Prize Interview</h2>
<article class="videoRight"><p>I was invited by BBC Berkshire to provide some insight into the Nobel Prize award for Dr David Julius and Dr Ardem Patapoutian, as well as our pain research in Berkshire. Dr Julius & Patapoutian won their Nobel prize due to their groundbreaking work on neural pathology, and their joint discoveries of sensory nerves that respond selectively to heat, pressure and cold.  </p>

<article class="videoLeft">     
<p>I was recently invited to present my work on pain during hysteroscopy at the Royal College of Obstetrics & Gynaecology. Although I was pre-emptively worried about a defensive reaction from the clinical community, the poster was very well received and I received a lot of positive feedback on the importance of our work. Click to the right to have a look at my presentation, I’d recommend full-screen if you’d like to read some of the more specific points.    </p>

<br><h2>Talk Radio Europe</h2>
<article class="videoRight"><p>A short interview with Bill Padley of Talk Radio Europe about our Mind/Body study, described below in the Conversation and Independent. This was the first accomplishment after self-isolation from Corona began and can be sensed throughout the entire interview (in my opinion).</p>

<p>This was recorded while introducing BBC Berkshire and its listeners to the CINN Pain lab and the type of research we undertake at Reading. I am joined by Dr Wiebke Gandhi from my lab to give Phil Kennedy and Jo Beck a demonstration of our work and an overview of why we do exactly what we do.</p>
